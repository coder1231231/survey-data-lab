Through these analyzes of the airline safety dataset I found out how to compare different columns and plot the information into frequency charts of bar graphs. Individually, I found out how to further analyze survey data including how to analyze multiple choice surveys but could not apply them into the airline safety dataset since it was not a multiple choice survey.
